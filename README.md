## 2ND QUIZ REPORT DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHM

For this second Quiz we’re making a game called “Number Guessing”. The player of this game divide into 2, use the player who guessing the number which already generated by Computer via random. If you want another player, you can do that.

In here We’re using BST to the computer to generating the number. If the player(s) guess(ess) lower than the randomed(?) number, then the computer will tell you that you need higher to guess and vice versa. If you can guess it, the game will break and and tell you how many you attempted to  guessed it and tell that you’ll win and vice versa.

In here We’re using Python Version 3.
